# tuicraft

A headless WoW 3.3.5a client that speaks the binary protocol from a terminal.
Authenticate via SRP-6, enter the world as a character via your account. Built
with Bun and TypeScript, zero runtime dependencies.

tuicraft targets AzerothCore private servers and is designed to be both human
and LLM friendly.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvararu/tuicraft/main/.github/install.sh | sh
```

## Features

🔐 **Authentication** — SRP-6 login, Arc4-encrypted world session, realm
selection, character select

💬 **Chat** — Say, yell, whisper, guild, party, raid, and channel messages with
`/r` reply support

👥 **Party Management** — Invite, kick, leave, leader transfer, accept/decline
invitations, live group roster with member stats

🔍 **Who Search** — Query online players with filters, human and JSON output

🖥️ **Interactive TUI** — Readline-based terminal UI with slash commands and
channel switching

🤖 **CLI & Daemon** — Auto-starting background daemon with Unix socket IPC, pipe
mode, JSONL output for scripting

📝 **Session Logging** — Persistent session log with `tuicraft logs` playback

⚡ **Zero Dependencies** — Pure TypeScript on Bun, compiles to a single binary

## Development

Requires [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), automatically installs `bun`:

```
mise trust -y
mise bundle
mise build
```

## Testing

```
mise test
```

To run live integration tests against a real server, copy the example config and
fill in your credentials:

```
cp mise.local.toml.example mise.local.toml
# edit mise.local.toml with your account details
mise test:live
```

## Usage

```
./dist/tuicraft help                # show help
./dist/tuicraft setup
./dist/tuicraft                     # interactive TUI
./dist/tuicraft "Hello world"       # send a say message (auto-starts daemon)
./dist/tuicraft -w Hemet "Hey"      # whisper
./dist/tuicraft read --wait 5       # read events, wait up to 5s
./dist/tuicraft tail                # continuous event stream
./dist/tuicraft status              # daemon status
./dist/tuicraft stop                # stop daemon
```

## Roadmap
