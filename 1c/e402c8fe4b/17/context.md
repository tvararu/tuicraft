<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

Base directory for this skill: /home/openclaw/code/tuicraft/.claude/skills/typescript-style

# TypeScript Style

Prettier with defaults handles formatting.
This covers structure and taste.

## Types

- `type` only. No `interface`, no `enum`.
- `as const` objects for opcode tables and constant maps.
- Unions for enumerations: `type Status = "active" | "pending"`
- Never `any`. Reserve `unknown` for true boundaries. If you know the type, use
  it.
- Discriminated unions over loose fields. `User...

### Prompt 5

Good work. Now finish up:
1. Commit all remaining changes (separate logical commits with proper conventional commit prefixes — feat: for new handlers, test: for tests, chore: for stub removal, docs: for README)
2. Push the branch
3. Do NOT open the PR yet — I will review first

Run git log after pushing so I can see all commits.

### Prompt 7

You are an expert code reviewer. Follow these steps:

      1. If no PR number is provided in the args, run `gh pr list` to show open PRs
      2. If a PR number is provided, run `gh pr view <number>` to get PR details

### Prompt 8

# Simplify: Code Review and Cleanup

Review all changed files for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues found.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

Run `git diff` (or `git diff HEAD` if there are staged changes) to see what changed. If there are no git changes, review the most recently modified files that the user mentioned or that you edited earlier in this conversation.

## Phase 2: Launch Three Review Agents in Parallel

Use the Agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a si...

### Prompt 9

Amend the formatters commit (the one that added GuildEvent formatters). Then force-push.

### Prompt 10

Coverage is not 100%. Uncovered lines:
- src/daemon/commands.ts lines 676-697 (formatGuildEvent switch cases) and 709-747 (formatGuildEventObj switch cases)
- src/wow/world-handlers.ts lines 734-769, 774-775

Add tests to cover these lines. The formatGuildEvent/formatGuildEventObj functions are private, so test them through onGuildEvent. Check the existing onGuildEvent test — it only covers guild-roster. Add tests for the new event types (promotion, demotion, motd, joined, left, removed, lead...
