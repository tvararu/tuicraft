<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

### Prompt 2

Add DND and AFK status commands. /dnd [message] sends CMSG_CHAT_SET_DND (opcode from wow_messages reference), /afk [message] sends CMSG_CHAT_SET_AFK. Receiving is already handled since they come as chat message types. Follow the same pattern as say/yell/emote. Branch, implement with full test coverage, open a PR. Use feat: prefix for commits.

# TypeScript Style

Prettier with defaults handles formatting.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```
